- **Definition:** **Probability** is the mathematical language to quantify uncertainty.
- **Definition:** A **sample space** is set of possible outcomes of an experiment
- **Definition:** Points in the sample space are called **outcomes**
- **Definition:** Subset of the sample space are called **events**.
	- **Sample space:** Different grades
	- **Outcome:** 75 / 100
	- **Event:** All grades greater than 50
- **Definition:** A set of events are **disjoints** or **mutually exclusive** if their intersection of any pair of events (not the same) is an empty set 
- **Definition:** A partition of a sample space is a set of disjoints events such that their union is the sample space it self.
- Probability distribution is a function that maps any event A to a real numcher and follows the three axioms:
	- It is bounded below by zero
	- Its integral over the sample space is 1
	- If a set of events in the sample space are disjoints then, the output of that function for the union of events is the sum of the output of the same function for each event.
- Different interpretations of a probability distribution leads to different schools of thoughts
	- **Frequentists:** a probability distribution describes in the long run the proportion of time an event might occur.
	- **Bayesian:** a probability distribution describes in the long run the the observer belief strength in the truthfulness of A.
- **Definition:** A uniform probability distribution is  a distribution such that all the events in its population are equally likely to occur.
	- It is a contunuous distribution
- Two events  $A$ and $B$ are independent if:
$$
\mathbb{P}(A B)=\mathbb{P}(A) \mathbb{P}(B)
$$
- Independence is sometimes assumed and sometimes derived.
	- Coin tosses
- The conditional probability of A given B is the proportion of A events that happens among those in B. or the ratio of both events happening with respect to be happening B
