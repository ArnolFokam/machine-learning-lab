- Tasks being intiutive to humans are quite difficult for computers to perform as it is hard to describe formally through mathematical equations such tasks.
- At some point during the course of AI, people have tried to build vast knowledge based system as a approach to artificial intelligence but with no major sucess. ([CycL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CycL))
- This revealed a need for AI systems to build their own knowledge system themselves. 
- The performance of these systems depends how data given to them is **represented**.
- These representations often come from pieces of information identified as feature.
- This dependence on representation also often arises in human life. For example,

> *People can easily perform arithmetic on Arabic numerals, but ﬁnd arithmetic on Roman
> numerals much more time-consuming.*

- The role of **Deep Learning** here is to learn these representations from experience and data.
